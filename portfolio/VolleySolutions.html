        <p>This video was to be posted across the company's social media channels and front-and-center on the website to advertise Greenscape's great track-record with large-scale remodeling projects.</p>


        <h2>2 Sisters Farm Promo</h2>

        <p>This company was undergoing rapid expansion within a short time frame. Having just expanded into the commercial hemp processing industry, and being one of very few to attempt large-scale hemp cultivation in Illinois, it was worth brushing up on my drone skills to achieve the shots neccesary for this impressive demo video. </p>
