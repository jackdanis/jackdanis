            <h2>Yorkshire Terrier</h2>
            <p>The <b>Yorkshire Terrier</b> (often shortened as <b>Yorkie</b>) is one of the smallest dog breeds of the terrier type and indeed of any dog breed. The breed developed during the 19th century in Yorkshire, England. Ideally its maximum size is 7 pounds (3.2&nbsp;kg). A popular companion dog, the Yorkshire Terrier has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the Silky Terrier. Most have a black and tan coat, but they are also known to have a silver-grey or a blonde coat. </p>

            <h3>History</h2>
            <p>The Yorkshire Terrier originated in <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Get_to_Know_the_Yorkshire_Terrier_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Get_to_Know_the_Yorkshire_Terrier-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Weston_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Weston-3">[3]</a></sup> In the mid-19th century, workers from Scotland came to Yorkshire in search of work and brought with them several varieties of <a href="/wiki/Terrier" title="Terrier">terrier</a>. Breeding of the Yorkshire terrier was "principally accomplished by the people—mostly operatives in cotton and woollen mills—in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire."<sup id="cite_ref-Shields_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shields-4">[4]</a></sup>  In the 1800s, miners wanting to develop a ratting terrier, bred Black-and-Tan Terriers with the Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Details are scarce. Mrs A. Foster is quoted as saying in 1886, "If we consider that the mill operatives who originated the breed were nearly all ignorant men, unaccustomed to imparting information for public use, we may see some reason why reliable facts have not been easily attained."</p>
            <p>The breed comes from two distinct dogs, a male named Old Crab, a female named Kitty, and another female whose name is not known.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Paisley_Terrier" title="Paisley Terrier">Paisley Terrier</a>, a smaller version of the <a href="/wiki/Skye_Terrier" title="Skye Terrier">Skye Terrier</a> that was bred for a beautiful long silky coat, also figured into the early dogs. Some authorities believed that the <a href="/wiki/Maltese_dog" title="Maltese dog">Maltese</a> was used as well.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> "They were all originally bred from Scotch Terriers (meaning dogs from Scotland, not today's <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Terrier" title="Scottish Terrier">Scottish Terrier</a>) and shown as such the name Yorkshire Terrier was given to them on account of their being improved so much in Yorkshire."<sup id="cite_ref-Foster_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Foster-6">[6]</a></sup> Yorkshire Terriers were shown in a dog show category (class) at the time called "Rough and Broken-coated, Broken-haired Scotch and Yorkshire Terriers". Hugh Dalziel, writing in 1878, says that "the classification of these dogs at shows and in the Kennel Club Stud Book is confusing and absurd" in lumping together these different types.</p>
            <h4>In North America</h4>
            <p>The Yorkshire Terrier was introduced in North America in 1872<sup id="cite_ref-Weston_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Weston-3">[3]</a></sup> and the first Yorkshire Terrier was registered with the <a href="/wiki/American_Kennel_Club" title="American Kennel Club">American Kennel Club</a> (AKC) in 1885.<sup id="cite_ref-Get_to_Know_the_Yorkshire_Terrier_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Get_to_Know_the_Yorkshire_Terrier-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Coile5_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Coile5-13">[13]</a></sup> During the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a>, the Yorkshire Terrier was a popular pet, and show dog in England, and as Americans embraced Victorian customs, so too did they embrace the Yorkshire Terrier.<sup id="cite_ref-Yorkshire_Terrier_-_Yahoo!_Pets_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Yorkshire_Terrier_-_Yahoo!_Pets-14">[14]</a></sup> The breed's popularity dipped in the 1940s, when the percentage of small breed dogs registered fell to an all-time low of 18% of total registrations.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Smoky_(dog)" title="Smoky (dog)">Smoky</a>, a Yorkshire Terrier and famous <a href="/wiki/War_Dog" class="mw-redirect" title="War Dog">war dog</a> from World War II, is credited with beginning a renewal of interest in the breed.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> The AKC ranked the Yorkshire Terrier as the 6th most popular purebred in the United States in 2012 and 2013.</p>
